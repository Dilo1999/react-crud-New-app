# React CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React.js, Axios, and React-Bootstrap. The app allows users to perform CRUD operations on items, which can include uploading images. It communicates with a backend server using Axios to store and retrieve data.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new items to the list with optional image uploads.
- **Read**: Display a list of all items with their names and images.
- **Update**: Edit existing items (name and image).
- **Delete**: Delete individual items or delete all data at once.
- **Responsive**: Designed using React-Bootstrap to be mobile-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Bootstrap**: Bootstrap components for React.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- **Node.js**: Backend for handling API requests (if you have a backend set up).
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for the app.
- **Bootstrap**: Styling framework for layout and components.
